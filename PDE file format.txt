The simple image format or PDE format consists of a small header followed by image data.

The header consists of a series of 32-bit unsigned integers:
0. (bytes 0-3)		endianness marker: the value 27
1. (bytes 4-7)		version of the file format (currently 1)
2. (bytes 8-11)		the number of images in the file
3. (bytes 12-15)	the x size of an image
4. (bytes 16-19)	the y size of an image
5. (bytes 20-23)	the storage type of a single pixel:
						5:	UINT16
						7:	UINT32
						10:	FP32
						11:	FP64

Following this short header the images are stored sequentially, one after the other, with nothing in between, in row-major order
(first writing a values for a given x coordinate, going through y, and then moving to the next x-coordinate).

All output is written in little-endian format.
