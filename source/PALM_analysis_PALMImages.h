 * @brief A class responsible for calculating a bitmap PALM output image by adding an individual Gaussian for every position to the image.
 * The output image is returned as a Image.
 * 
 * PALMBitmapImageCalculator takes a set of positions in a LocalizedPositionsContainer and creates an output image (2D) with sizes (xSize, ySize).
 * For every position it adds a Gaussian to the output image with an integrated contribution that is either equal to to integrated intensity
 * of the fitted emission, or equal to one, depending on the value of emitterWeighingMethod_rhs. The standard deviation of the Gaussian
 * is determined by which of the PALMBitmapImageDeviationCalculator is passed into the constructor.
